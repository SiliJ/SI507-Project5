Put your Project 5 brief explanation, as directed, here.
get two themed events from Eventbrite.
I am accessing the Eventbrite search API and gathering:
    - All coming events for each of 2 themes(TEDx and Thanksgiving) that I'm going to search for
    - For each event, I'll be accessing the event name, event description, event time, event_organizer, event location, event format and event logo
    - I'll write 2 CSV files, one for each theme's search
    - Data in each CSV file: 7 columns --event name, event url, event timezone, Event_Start_time, Event_organizer_id,Event venue id and Event_Format_id
    - URL for the API: <https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/events/search/?token=<token>>
    - If necessary, URL describing the authentication process for the API: <https://www.eventbrite.com/developer/v3/quickstart/>
